* He was abused &amp; hit by a car in Delhi for not chanting ""Jai Shri Ram""

But CCTV &amp; eyewitness punctured the claim of Mohammed Momin

Nowadays even the CCTVs act like Communal Sanghis Modi Govt needs to bring a law- all fake allegations of -

1) attack for not chanting Jai Shri Ram
2) attack on basis of Religion 
3) attack by gau rakshaks etc

FAKE ALLEGATIONS be made a Crime &amp; punished. Pakistani state sponsorship of terrorism will continue &amp; more than likely increase. China will soon assume the presidency of the Financial Action Task Force &amp; Saudi Arabia will become a member. Both countries will protect Pakistan from terrorism sanctions.

And Article 24 of GATT requires agreement #fortheavoidanceofdoubt (a) The implementation period is part of the withdrawal agreement. No withdrawal agreement means no implementation period.
(b) Article 24 of GATT requires both parties to consent. It‚Äôs not an alternative to no deal. It‚Äôs a form of deal - and it won‚Äôt be in place by 31 October. If your Brexit strategy involves:

(a) leaving without a deal but negotiating an FTA during the implementation period; or

(b) making unilateral use of Article 24 of GATT

you don‚Äôt have a credible Brexit strategy.

If your strategy involves both (a) and (b), ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. No. There would be No implementation period in your scenario.

I would have the finish of his swing and in the background there would be young children with special needs cheering and smiling.

The HR today was a magical moment.  After tomorrow, you may never see Albert Pujols play baseball in STL again.  However, for many of us, we can say we saw one of the greatest players in MLB history.  The fans have made this very special. Albert Pujols said Mike Trout told him playing in this series feels like the posteason every at-bat, every play.
Pujols said he told Trout, ""I lived that for 11 years here."" Toy Story 4 gives the original a run for it's money for best movie in the series no cap just found my new Nintendo Switch bag https://t.co/wyDWXcAJIy That was an amazing night for a @Cardinals game.

Just me? Going to be a tough moment when Pujols steps up to the plate tonight. Show out, cards fans. Welcome back @PujolsFive   You were a great teammate, you are a great friend, and one of the greatest @Cardinals /baseball players to ever live.  I don't know what the record for longest ovation is but I hope you pass that tonight @charlie_hdz92 @derek_teusch 100,000%.

Good fucking job. @TweetinJustin7 Design is honestly pretty dope but I don't think I want anything to remind me of last season #32 has Carson Edwards written all over it. we‚Äôre on pace to win 30-0 btw let‚Äôs see if that holds up Sweden, a top 10 powerhouse, doesn't even have a shot before we have a goal üòÇüòÇüòÇ DREAM START FOR THE USA! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

With the destruction of their preferred overwintering habitat comes greater fragmentation among populations, leading to more sites but far fewer total bflies. Give me a fucking break. @___Slewis___ A lot of people use the argument that increasing overwintering sites means everything is fine for monarchs, even though individual counts are drastically decreased. How many more excuses can we find until people just admit they don't really give a shit.
